This is my portfolio made with react

# here is a link to a live demo 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VkQ-ikyTwgJfN5U2V_DvpC0vkQBiBOzc/view

I used several new npm's such as, react-scroll, react-hook-form, emailjs-com, etc.

The contact form is fully hooked up with emailjs-com and is connected to my main email, has validation, form fields must be filled out or error messages will be shown, form clears and shows a success message if filled out correctly. projects are displayed with react-popupbox.

react-scroll is used to navigate the page, links for page navigation are in navbar and footer.

email, phone number, mailing address all located in footer.

when i deploy this i will be allowing it to be shared with the facebook share button located in the footer, as well ass linkedin sharing for future employers etc.

portfolio component has project 1 and 2 fully hooked up with links, will add project 3 when completed.

Linked to my github on the header and footer, linked to my linkedin on the header. 

Also, I used react particles and typed-text for header effects.



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
