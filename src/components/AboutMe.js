            My name is Wettim Linton, I'm Native American, Hawaiian, and African American. I'm currently enrolled in the
            UCI Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. I'm looking forward to learning all there is to know about web development in
            order to create fantastic websites! As for other aspects of my life I have have played sports and videos
            games my whole life, some examples include: Football, Basketball, Baseball and Counter strike. When I am not
            actively
            involved in any of these I also work out constantly. I enjoy making myself the best I can be. Aside from all
            of this I am very excited at the progress of my coding skills after only seven weeks. You can take a look at
            my github linked to the right or look below for my projects. Thank you!
